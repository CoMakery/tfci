# Tools For Collaborative Innovation

**We are co-authoring a book!**

We began during collaborative sessions at the Future of Working conference on March 20th 2015. Let us know if you have feedback or would like to participate.

## Future of Working Conference Sessions

The initial content for this book began taking shape on March 20th, 2015 at the [Future of Working](http://www.futureofworking.org) conference. Here is the content from these sessions:

* In depth content for [Mechanics of Collaboration: CryptoEquity and Currency](cryptoequity-cobudgeting-currency.md)
* An invitation to co-author 1 page [Agreements For Adaptive Organizations](agreements_for_adaptive_organizations.md)

## Road Map

The book is being catalyzed by Noah Thorp with the sponsorship of Citizen Code.
