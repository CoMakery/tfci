# Agreements For Adaptive Organizations

Please note, this is not legal advice on LLC Operating Agreements. Consult your lawyer for drafting LLC, C Corp, and other legal documents.

###Founding Observations Of Adaptive Organizations

“You need people who are adaptable because the thing that makes you the best in the world in one generation of games is going to be totally useless in the next. So specialization in gaming is sort of the enemy of the future. We had to think about if we’re going to be in a business that’s changing that quickly, how do we avoid institutionalizing one set of production methods in such a way that we can’t adapt to what’s going to be coming next.” - [Gabe Newell, Valve Software](http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/the-switch/wp/2014/01/03/gabe-newell-on-what-makes-valve-tick/)

“The business changes. The technology changes. The team changes. The team members change. The problem isn't change, per se, because change is going to happen; the problem, rather, is the inability to cope with change when it comes.” - Kent Beck, Extreme Programming Explained

“These people are leaving for home where they will manage their lives, why not here at work?”  - [Chris Rufer, Founder & CEO of Morning Star](http://www.self-managementinstitute.org/)

### The Need For Simple Agreements

By 2020 freelancers are expected to make up 50% of the work force. Emergent teams in adaptive organizations and networks of freelancers need clear agreements for delegating roles and making decisions. 
 
We are also in the midst of a profound shift from predictable factory processes to complex creative innovative work. In complex contexts individually driven responsiveness to change trumps efficient execution of traditional hierarchies. Numerous methodologies and company processes have emerged for structuring self-organizing and self-managing teams. These include the approaches of Holacracy, Sociocracy, podularity, wirearchy, SEMCO, Enspiral, Valve, and Morning Star Farms.

The common criticism of many of these approaches is their complexity, unfamiliarity, and difficulty of adoption. In newly formed groups with work pressures, there is little time to dedicate to learning new ways of operating.

### Back To First Principles

What simple seed agreements can enable 2-20 people with a common purpose to respond to rapidly changing conditions? 

An answer to this question should fit into a 1 page agreement that all members of the group can understand. The agreement should also build in the capacity to change and evolve. 

A great example for understanding evolvable agreements is the game [Nomic](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nomic). Nomic was first described by Peter Suber in his writing on the "The Paradox of Self-Amendment".

Elinor Ostrom’s design principles for stable local common pool resource management also offer great insight into drafting an effective agreement. Her principles are:
1. Clearly defined boundaries (effective exclusion of external un-entitled parties);
1. Rules regarding the appropriation and provision of common resources that are adapted to local conditions;
1. Collective-choice arrangements that allow most resource appropriators to participate in the decision-making process;
1. Effective monitoring by monitors who are part of or accountable to the appropriators;
1. A scale of graduated sanctions for resource appropriators who violate community rules;
Mechanisms of conflict resolution that are cheap and of easy access;
1. Self-determination of the community recognized by higher-level authorities; and
1. In the case of larger common-pool resources, organization in the form of multiple layers of nested enterprises, with small local CPRs at the base level.


### A Template For Drafting An Agreement

Here is a set of questions to draft a simple agreement for your team. We are interested in compiling, open sourcing, and testing the agreements that you come up with. Please be in touch if you are active in this area.

**Exploring Adaptability**

1. What are the attributes of an organization that can respond to internal and external change?
1. What values would you want your adaptive organization to reflect?
1. How can an organization allow for spontaneous leadership?

**Essential Agreements**

1. Agree on how the group will make decisions that apply to the whole group. This essential agreement allows you to decide on the other agreements. It also typically requires consensus for adoption.
1. Agree on how people will enter into agreements with each other
1. Agree on how a person is permitted to participate in group decision making
1. Agree on how individuals are permitted to use common resources (e.g. money, a car)
1. Agree on how disputes between two people will be resolved
1. Agree on how people prioritize what they spend their time on
1. Agree on how sanctions are enforced for people who do not follow the agreements
