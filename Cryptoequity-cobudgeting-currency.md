# CryptoEquity, Co-bugeting, and Currency
## Future of Working Conference Session Transcript, March 20th 2015

Noah Thorp convened and framed the session with the question: 

**How can crypto-equity, co-budgeting, and currency enable shared value creation for individuals, organizations, and ecosystems?**

####David Thomson & Maysa Ibrahim Founders of Artlery

**David:**

Artlery is experimenting with finance and value - thinking about art as an asset class in such a way that it is not a commodity. In the current world artists feel that it’s a transactional commodity. Art exists in the world - so it is associated with money. Art always has had an interesting relationship with money - but it transcends that. 

Art is important. I believe we have never had meaningful progress in civilization without progress in art. Science and technology can’t advance without complementary advancement in art. It’s never happened. 

With Artlery we attach iBeacon sensors to the artwork. The closest piece of art will show on our app. There’s a button called “appreciate” for you to appreciate the art. When you indicate your “appreciation” in the app you receive partial ownership of the artwork. We track this ownership on the bitcoin block chain. When the art sells you receive an immediate distribution proportional to your ownership.

**Maysa:**

What’s one of the factors that might influence your choice of which piece of art you would appreciate? 

**Audience Member:** Its valuation?

**Maysa:**

Yes exactly - its valuation. It is almost as if the value of the work has already been chosen for you by the art market. If I told you that one of these was worth $62,000 and and another was worth $2500 you would want to know. You are curious. Not only because you want a share - but also that price is telling you what society finds is of value.

What I have found working in the art world is that you can make an artist. You can make society think their art is valuable by making a price that has been put on their work. 

However, a general appreciator can not “make” the value of the work. Through the Artlery app appreciation can make artists in a different way - through the accumulation of appreciation and ownership by a wider audience a collective valuation can be set.

####Matthew Deiters Founder of Assembly Presentation

Assembly.com allows engineers, product people, and designers from all over the world to collaborate. They take ownership over what they are building and we distribute 90% of the revenue monthly to the creators.

Before now we haven’t had a good way to collaborate with strangers and to have common trust. We are focused on helping people to collaborate and reward them for what they build. The community rallies around what they like best.

There is a bounty system for design, copy, and code. The core team allocates bounties and people work for ownership of App Coins. App Coins are product specific crypto currency. These are stored on the blockchain using colored coins. At the end of the month we pay the expenses and distribute the proceeds based on ownership.

When we started we wanted to create a democratic, open, and collaborative environment. We’ve learned a number of things.

We have learned that a core part of collaboration is having a way to make decisions. We wanted this to be cooperative - but we were polarized even on our own team on how to do this. Is it 1 person 1 vote? Is it ownership based? Do people with a majority make decisions? We went to the community to help us decide.

We went to the community in the end. People recognize that great products need a voice and a direction. People recognized the need for leadership. Contributors recognized that the people who are most invested are most likely to make good decisions for the product.

The other thing that we learned is, clear is greater than clever. How do you structure ownership so it’s not gamable? But as you build in rules it makes for an opaque system. That can erode the trust. Simplicity allows people to understand and build trust.

The other thing that is important is why people participate. Like for the art is it about the ownership or is because you like the art. I think the intrinsic reasons are much more valuable. Projects early on people are more generous with equity. People think I am part of this and I am building this with the community. People are not concerned about the exact dollar amount they are going to get.

In the successful projects the rewards are much more extrinsic. It changes the dynamics of cooperation. In some ways it can kill or corrupt the collaboration. What I am most excited about is being able to build new things - to reward the intrinsic value of just creating something with a group of people.

There’s only so much that you can innovate on. With large distributed groups of people - there are still norms. People want to ask for permission and getting involved. When it comes to incentives and rewards in a collaborative environment that we are less aggressive than what we started out with. Simplicity and understandability, roles, position helps create some structure that helps the platform to move forward.

How do you think about the optimal amount of mediation? Or how much to provide an open platform?

For the most part we should get out of the way and let people use the tools they want to. For us it’s about creating transparency. If one team is not as fair as another we want people to be able to see that across all products. But for the most part it’s about providing tools and getting out of the way.

What about setting the value of bounties? Originally people could participate in the valuation based on complexity and the value for that product. But the community doesn’t want to participate in that - they trust the core team. The core team understands the value that should be associated with things. We are moving in that direction. People trust leadership if they can understand their decision making process.

####John Light - The Future of Work in A Peer to Peer Society

I work with the "Ok Turtles Foundation". I have a podcast called P2P Connects Us. I am going to outline the necessary pieces of a peer to peer infrastructure.

Although BitTorrent was my introduction to peer to peer technology - the block chain has an opportunity to change society on the social level. The blockchain is a distributed database that allows anyone to download and store the data and act as a relay for information stored in the block chain. 

The block chain has decentralized transaction ordering built into it. If I send 2 conflicting transactions there is a reconciliation process. If I have $1 and try to send 2 people that dollar - who get’s the dollar? Bitcoin and blockchain based systems have a mechanism for this consensus process. Bitcoin uses proof of work but there are other options for this reconciliation process. 

Essentially, we have immutable records. Everyone has a copy of the database, so if someone says history is different everyone else can say “no that’s not true.”

Distributed applications or smart contracts are basically programs with pre-defined transaction rules that are self-executing. These can be simple or complex. For instance if an account value  = $1 it goes to Bob. 

Bitcoin has basic smart contract systems. More ambitious types of systems like Ethereum are trying to generalize this. For instance codifying how entire organizations are managed. A smart contract could say it takes agreement of a majority of members to add people to a contract. Then ownership can be defined in the contract. You can build these out as simple or complex as you want them to be. Then you can have autonomous organizations that don’t require external accounting. This is a way that fund distribution can be automated, made transparent, and without requiring trust in an administrator.

Distributed hash table technology can enable a distributed database, but the focus it is more on distributed file storage and sharing. You wouldn’t store files in a blockchain. You don’t want the world to need to come to consensus on large files. If you have the hash (address) of the file you can have access. Then you know where to find the file.

When you combine the blockchain, cryptocurrency, smart contracts, and distributed hash tables you have the infrastructure for a distributed internet with value at the core. You can imagine a YouTube not owned by a central company, with files not stored on a central server, limitations on centralized surveillance, and distribution of value based on popularity.

Then there are mesh networks - this is peer to peer internet without ISPs. 

Moving on to peer to peer philosophy, there are new peer to peer ways of running collectives. Holacracy, cooperatives, swarms (see “Swarmrise” by Rick Falkvinge).

Then we should find a way to create basic income so we can be peers. Everyone has a base standard of living and people can build on top of that. Creatives can create and if they make money on top of that great! If they don’t they are not homeless and they are not starving.

P2P culture is something of interest to me but it’s also a trend that is gaining popularity.

Ed West: We live in a culture where there are rules but we also implicitly accept exceptions.
How can a world organized by smart contracts avoid becoming dystopic? For instance, there’s a clause in my lease that says if I’m late I have to pay 15% penalty and if I don’t pay twice I will be evicted. Where does human judgement and mercy come in. Or, what if I speed on the freeway. How do you negotiate against a Distributed Autonomous Corporation?

Primavera De Filippi: It’s wrong to assume that a smart contract is an exclusively computer mediated mechanism. For you can add an arbitration clause that requires that a judge interprets. You can create a governance system that includes humans. As soon as there is a leap of complexity then you probably want to rely on human beings. But in this case you can see: here is the point a person was asked to make a decision and here is what they said. It can be a human system but it’s organized in a decentralized manner.

John Light: The challenge will be to find the balance between the “dry code” of computers and smart contracts - and the “wet code” of our hearts.

Presentation on CryptoEquity, Distributed Autonomous Organizations, and Decentralization

CryptoEquity allows a participants to become a partner. In the Artlery example we have an art piece. Previously we only had an artist and a collector. Artlery allows the public to become a partner and to be encouraged to promote it. I know that my share will increase in value.

This completely changes that dynamic of the art world. The art world is very exclusive and horrible. I know because both of my parents are painters. I hate the art world because it is really exclusive. Art should be democratic and as public as possible. Through CryptoEquity we can actually give it back to the public. Then the artists and the appreciators have the same incentive.

The other area is to use CryptoEquity for fund raising. In contrast to the Kickstarter model, CryptoEquity allows funders to become partners and stakeholders. In this model funders can participate in the success of the project. Instead of contributing because they want a gadget, they can become a partner of the success of the project.
W
I would love to apply to this model to Assembly. (To Matt CEO of Assembly) Interesting if you would be interested in decentralizing at the level of the Asembly organization itself.

The idea of using CryptoEquity at the level of the organization eliminates the boundaries of the organization. This allows you to focus on the project components. You contribute to the components and get shares in the components - but you don’t have to live in a closed system where you contribute to one box. Where those boxes have common components there is redundancy. By eliminating the boundaries and operating in this fashion we can eliminate the “tragedy of boxes”.

Then the competition only happens at the edge. It moves from competitive walled gardens to a more collaborative inclusive world.

Rather than using exclusivity to create incentives - the goal of the future is to be disseminated as widely as possible. With CryptoEquity we can create interest in dissemination similarly to Artlery. If I get a share every time I disseminate I become a partner in dissemination. With cryptography you can rely on the people who are currently seen as free riders to disseminate your work.

If we apply the same system we rely on in bitcoin for mining pools for innovation research - we can maintain a share based on how much people contribute to the pool. Once the discovery is made you get a common patent. Then the compensation can be based on contribution.

A distributed system doesn’t rely on a hierarchical structure. The intermediaries can be distributed organizations rather than a central mediator like Uber etc. It is a real peer to peer system. This is a really good thing. Another question is how to get these communities to scale up. How can we get the community to develop coordination and trust. You have the tragedy of the commons and free riding. With crypto equity you can create cooperation at scale and it becomes possible to incentivize collaboration on shares, privilege, and currency. Up until now this type of collaboration could not scale because of free riding.

David Fidler: Could you run a DAC on top of existing models like odesk etc? For a private organization what would be the advantage?

Primavera: The foremost benefit of DACs is efficiency. (From an alternate perspective) why would a private actor decide to work for a centralized organization over a decentralized model? 

There are also options to create a private blockchain. Banks for instance may want a private blockchain that is not susceptible to 51% attacks etc.

We need a transition phase. 5 years is elimination of transaction cost. 10 years is the elimination of redundancy. The core competency of an organization is not accounting if the company say wants to create a cup.. The competition should only be at the edge. The competition should only be on the things that are done differently. This avoids wasting time on the common elements.
Before the conference Christopher Allen said:
These kind of ideas [about CryptoEquity] have their roots in Nic Szabo’s concepts about Smart Contracts, which he started writing about in 1994 http://szabo.best.vwh.net/smart.contracts.html — there are many interesting possiblities here besides bitcoin and distributed autonomous corporations (DACs)
I will add that many of the harder problems here are with the intersection of computer trust and human trust, what I call Progressive Trust. Pure autonomous systems will not be used by people unless they map well the way people work (which is not always rational). I write a little about how understanding this made SSL win over other approaches: http://www.lifewithalacrity.com/2004/08/progressive_tru.html

What would collaboration and organizational structures look like in an enlightened society of the future?  Reverse engineer it.

Facilitated by Harlan T Wood.  Participants: Evonne Heyning, David Thomson

Abundance is foundational.  People create value by doing what they love.
Fractal equity based fluid organizational structures
Money is less in your face.  Life is more about being & interacting.  All the value you create does add to your balances of various forms of currency.
Individuals and groups have all the autonomy and privacy (even invisibility) they may desire, while also having great systems for discovering and interacting with collaborators.
Personal insight mirrors.  Seeing yourself more deeply, and collaborators as well.
Visualizing existing projects in semantic space, according to your preferred system.
View of the long now: foresight.
Forkability of projects: if one fork goes off the rails, it need not effect other forks.
Transparency of automation -- ability to introspect and see the processes by which machine intelligences are tracking complex conclusions.

How can we enable humans assemble in a way that maximizes the utilization of their creativity? Using cities as a model of emergent productivity at different fractal scales.
Facilitated by Edward West, Seb Paquet.

City as metaphor became city as city, as we facilitated a collaborative workshop with Seb Paquet, Edward West, Kyle Stewart and Jennifer Sertl around the creation of intentional collaborative spaces in Rochester, New York for a 800k square foot collaborative incubator Jennifer is building.

How can new classes of labor work with existing organizations, institutions, and governments? Facilitated by Matt Brown.

As we move from corporations as the norm to independent work as the norm, what services and legal structures can be used to coordinate work?
Facilitated by Andrew Barr

CryptoEquity can violate securities law if it’s considered an investment contract. But the participation is not strictly for financial investment purposes. It is the judgement to regulate it in existing legal framework that is problem. We have to build regulation packages so that regulators know which package to use for CryptoEquity.

Distributed Autonomous Organizations and smart contracts are the most controversial partially because the word “contract” is a misnomer. A smart contract is to a contract what a koala bear is to a bear. They are different things.

For decentralized on demand work - how do we avoid a race to the bottom? There will be a few people that can leverage the swarm and gain an incredible concentration of wealth.

What is the safety net? We can re-imagine what the safety net is starting with basic income. A decentralized system could provide a floor for basic income. One option would be a decentralized network of services that also issued “basic living coins” - like an allowance.

The rise of corporation was also the fall of the bowling club and the society as dominant social organization. What we are trying to do is to try to find a way for individuals to create cooperative social organizations. Organizations based on existing communities also create a more collaborative base. 

Decentralized on demand work could fill the coordination gap for collective organization of the freelancers movement. For example, with Sarah Horowitz’s Freelancers Union the leaf has a tree to grab onto and find home. An organization like that which is already composed of freelancers could provide a good base for decentralized peer to peer crypto equity based systems to emerge.
