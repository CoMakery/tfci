# Operating Agreements For Adaptive Organizations

Emergent teams in adaptive organizations and networks of freelancers need clear agreements for delegating roles and making decisions. By 2020 freelancers are expected to make up 50% of the work force. We are also in the midst of a profound shift from predictable to complex contexts. 

In complex contexts individually driven responsiveness to change trumps the efficient execution of traditional static hierarchies. Numerous methodologies have emerged for structuring self-organizing and self-managing teams. These include the methods of Holacracy, Sociocracy, podularity, wirearchy, SEMCO, Enspiral, Valve, and Morning Star Farms.

The common criticism of many of these approaches is their complexity, unfamiliarity, and difficulty of adoption. In newly formed groups with work pressures, there is little time to dedicate to learning new ways of operating.

In this section we will explore concise, easily adopted, operating agreements for self-organization. We will answer the question: what is the minimal governance structure for an adaptable self-organizing team?
